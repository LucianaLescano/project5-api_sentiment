# Api Sentiment 

This week's project is all about creating our own API and be the data provider ü•≥.

Here you will find my Star Wars Scripts API, where you can ask for the characters and its dialogues. Also, if you want you can add new dialogues between different characters.

### About my MongoDB database

The database has three collections each one of them represeants a Star Wars movie. 

- Collection 1 - SW Episode IV 
- Collection 2 - SW Episode V
- Collection 3 - SW Episode VI

### Post Request 

#### New entry

A new entry will be added to an existing collection in MongoDB database. 

- Endpoint: 

    You must choose an endpoint based on what collection you want to add a new entry.

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/IV/newentry

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/V/newentry

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/VI/newentry

- Query parameters: 

    No parameters needed.

- To add:

    A dictionary with the character and dialogue values. As shown below:

    ```
    {'character': 'THREEPIO',
    'dialogue': "Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!"}
    ```

- Response:

    If you suceed on loading a new entry you will receive:  ‚ÄúNew entry successfully registered in the database‚Äù
